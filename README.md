Music and Sound 

PartA

Part A is all about turning a song into a dynamic visual experience. A glowing circle in the center pulses with the beat of the music, while colorful waves flow around it, reacting to the song's frequencies. You can click anywhere on the screen to play or pause the music, making it super interactive. The canvas stretches to fill the whole screen, so it always looks centered and smooth.

Using tools like p5.FFT to read the song's frequency data and p5.Amplitude to track the volume, the visualization comes to life with gradients, smooth waves, and flowing animations.

PartB

For Part B, I’ve taken the full song PartB.mp3 and turned it into a static visualization using the p5.js sound library. The entire song's amplitude data was captured with the getPeaks() function and mapped onto the canvas as smooth, symmetrical waveforms that stretch across the screen. A glowing gradient circle sits at the center, surrounded by a colorful background that gives the design a poster-like feel.

The goal was to represent the song’s energy and rhythm in a way that’s visually interesting and dynamic. The waveforms capture the highs and lows of the song, while the vibrant gradients and layered design make the whole piece feel like a mix of music and art. It’s my way of translating sound into something you can see.

The two songs I chose are non-copyrighted tracks, but I honestly don’t remember their names—I downloaded them mainly because they were copyright-free
